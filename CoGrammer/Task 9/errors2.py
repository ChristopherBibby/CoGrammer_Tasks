# This example program is meant to demonstrate errors.
 
# There are some errors in this program. Run the program, look at the error messages, and find and fix the errors.

# Syntax error = Lion needed to be in brackets to be a valid variable
animal = "Lion"
animal_type = "cub"
number_of_teeth = 16

# Logic error = formating needed for variable to be properly used
# Logic error = variable in the wrong place
full_spec = f"This is a {animal}. It is a {animal_type} and it has {number_of_teeth} teeth"

# Syntax error = brackets needed
print(full_spec)
